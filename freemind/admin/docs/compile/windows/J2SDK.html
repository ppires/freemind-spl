<h3>Installing Java 2 System Development Kit (J2SDK or JDK) </h3>
<p>Let's point our browser to the following URL: <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a></p>
<p>The section “Download J2SE” is what we are looking for (at the time of this writing it is the second section).</p>
<p>Look at the following picture to locate it:</p>
<p>
<img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot001_small.jpg" /></p>
<p class="style1">(click <a href="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot001.jpg">here</a> for a larger picture) </p>
<p class="style1">In the next screen  you will see that the Download J2SE section contains many lines, mostly one per each operating system. It also indicates that you can download either the runtime environment (JRE) or the full Java Development toolkit ((SDK). As indicated by the red ellipse we will be choosing the latter by clicking on the <em>download</em> link. </p>
<p class="style1">On the next screen just click to accept and continue:</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot002_small.jpg" width="313" height="281" /> </p>
<p><span class="style1">(click <a href="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot002.jpg">here</a> for a larger picture) </span></p>
<p>For Windows we have two lines. I could use the first (Offline Installation) which will yield a larger file to download but the resulting file can be installed also on machines without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>This time I decided to use the small online installer which implies installing on a machine which is (hopefully well) connected to Internet. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot003_small.jpg" width="313" height="281" /></p>
<p><span class="style1">(click <a href="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot003.jpg">here</a> for a larger picture) </span></p>
<p>The installer is small and downloads quickly. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot004.jpg" width="384" height="268" /></p>
<p>Launch it and now the &quot;real&quot; installation starts. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot005.jpg" width="504" height="386" /> </p>
<p>As always accept the agreement 8-&gt; </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot008.jpg" width="504" height="386" /></p>
<p>From the following screen please note that the SDK on top of the full development enviromnent which by default will get installed to c:\j2sdk1.4.2_03, will also install a JRE (runtime environment) which by defualt goes into your programs folder (in my case C:\Programmi) under a Java\jre1.4.2_03 directory. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot010.jpg" width="504" height="386" /></p>
<p>The installation will now download a lot of stuff from the network and will alternate many similar small windows. Just go and have supper. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot011.jpg" width="504" height="386" /></p>
<p>Hopefully when you come back, you will see everything is over. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot011b.jpg" width="504" height="386" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now dont' ask me why. The installation with the offline installer of version 1.4.2_02 will eat up <em>275MB</em> of disk space. The install with the online version of the 1.4.2_03 will occupy only <em>80MB</em> (plus the JRE). Simply accept all default values and take note of the place where the JDK and/or the JRE will be installed. </p>
<p>You might want to check that the installation has properly setup two environment variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JAVA_HOME </li>
  <li>PATH</li>
</ul>
<p>JAVA_HOME should point to the directory in which you have just installed the JDK. If you have chosen the default places it will be:</p>
<p><em>JAVA_HOME=c:\j2sdk1.4.2_03</em> or similar.</p>
<p>The PATH variable should contain the following: <em>%JAVA_HOME%\bin</em></p>
<p>In XP you can check the environment variables by opening a shell window (also called a DOS window for historical reasons ) and typing the <em>SET</em> command or right click on the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon and you get: </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot011c.jpg" width="419" height="504" /></p>
<p>Now click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; (Avanzate in my Italian version) tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot013.jpg" width="401" height="429" /> </p>
<p>And here click on the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; (Variabili d'ambiente) button.</p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot014.jpg" width="384" height="430" /></p>
<p>From here I have seen that my JAVA_HOME existed but points to an older release (1.4.2_02) </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot015.jpg" width="357" height="163" /></p>
<p>I want to point to my new 1.4.2_03 and therefore select JAVA_HOME and click on the Modify (Modifica) button and edit the field. In the next screenshot you can see that JAVA_HOME now points to 1.4.2_03. </p>
<p><img src="images/1.4.2_03/ScreenShot016.jpg" width="384" height="430" /> </p>
<p>In the same fashion you can check if thePATH variable contains the following: <em>%JAVA_HOME%\bin</em></p>
