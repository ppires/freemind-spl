<font face="Arial">You can create graphical links between two nodes, like this:</font></ul>
  <p>
<font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="tips.h1.gif" width="551" height="113"><br>
  To do so, mark a node and drag to another node
<b>holding both shift and control keys, and releasing the mouse button first.</b></li>
  </font>
  </p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">You can edit some properties of this link by right-clicking on the line between them.
</font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">You may choose the color and the arrow positions. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Go directly to one of the nodes (even if it's folded) 
  by using the link in the right-click menu. </font>

<p><font face="Arial">The current version of FreeMind has experimental file locking, which is disabled by default. 
The current implementation (0.7.1) does not really prevent race conditions, but it should be fine for the most practical purposes. What does file locking mean? It makes sure that multiple users do not edit the same map at the same time, preventing them from 
accidentally overwriting 
each other's information.
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial">You can enable experimental file locking if you are a technical user and are willing to edit user.properties, as described 
in <a href="customize.htm">Customizing FreeMind</a>.

  </h3>
  <p><font face="Arial">You can browse the mindmaps in browse mode. Why is there a separate mode for browsing? That's because browsing is the only thing you can do in 
  the FreeMind applet, which can be put to your website. Normally, you would not use browse mode in FreeMind.

<font face="Arial"><span style="color: #338800;">Browsing the files on your computer</span><font color="#338800">
</font>
</font>
  </h3>
  <p><font face="Arial">You can browse the files on your computer using file mode. To enter file mode, in menu: Modes &gt; File.
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial">You can then browse the file tree as if it was a mindmap. You can make any folder the root of the map by chosing "Center" from the node menu. To view or execute a file, follow the link of the node.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The file mode is currently not very useful; it is a demonstration that it's not too difficult to feed data into the tree from other source than 
the mindmap. There is no evidence that people would really use this mode.
</font>
</li>
  <h3>
  <span style="color: #669900;font-size: 83%;font-family: Arial; ">There is a concept of mode in FreeMind</span><font face="Arial">
</font></h3>
  <p><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Although Freemind is primarily a tool for editing 
  mindmaps, it is designed to be able to view data coming from different data sources. &nbsp;To make a specific data source available for viewing in FreeMind, a programmer has to write a so-called mode for that data source. In the standard, there is an example of such a mode, namely file mode. We do not know of any other modes implemented. It is not clear if anyone would really want to make use of this architecture, but it's here to be exploited if someone wants to.</span><font face="Arial">
  </font>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; ">Furthermore, there is code almost ready for Scheme Mode which enables you to edit scheme programs. Again, the usefulness is far from clear. While the mindmap mode is clearly a real thing, other modes seem to be more a demonstration of what is possible than something really used by people.</span><font face="Arial">
