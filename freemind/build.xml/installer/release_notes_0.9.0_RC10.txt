Dear FreeMind users, 

with this release, we continue the series of release candidates for the final version 0.9.0. 

It fixes some conversion errors for opening old maps from version 0.8.x.
For testers: we need *everybody* to do tests. From the simplest to the hardest (e.g. memory and performance tests using profilers). If you have time - join us and tell your results (in the open discussion forum or in the 
bugs section). 

Best regards, 

Chris

* Fix: Conversion from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0 drops newlines in notes - ID: 3021953: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3021953&group_id=7118&atid=107118
* Fix: Menu layout under MacOsX
* Removed HotEqn support, as it is poorly integrated. It is still in the code and may be compiled using the switch in the file plugins/build.xml setting include_latex to true.
* Reverted twiki export to the former version. The new one was copied to mm2twiki_headings.xsl and can be actived by a user's copy.
* Updated the german translation. Thanks to the authors.
* Fix: Freemind cannot find text with Greek characters - ID: 3035387 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3035387&group_id=7118&atid=107118
