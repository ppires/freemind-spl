Notes:


Dear FreeMind users,  
 
with this release, we continue the series of release candidates for
the final version 0.9.0. It fixes some nasty usability bugs.

For translators may still update the translations to the current
 set of strings, which hasn't changed since RC3.
 
For testers: we need *everybody* to do tests. From the simplest to the
hardest (e.g. memory and performance tests using profilers).
If you have time - join us and tell your results 
(in the open discussion forum or in the bugs section).  
 
Best regards,  
 
Chris
