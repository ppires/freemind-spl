</OBJECT>If you want to preview your map before you print it and have a Postscript printer or generic 
  Postscript driver, you can print the map into a file and view the Postscript file view 
  with Ghostview or similar software. Beware that if you try to print to a file 
  with a printer that does not understand 
  Postscript, the resulting file will not be Postscript but probably PCL, which is unusable for you.</font><p>
  <span style="font-family: Arial; ">You can also print from your browser after exporting 
  a map to HTML, or from Word or Wordpad after copying and pasting the map into it. You can also export the map into HTML with headings, copy and paste it into MS Word and print it from there. That way you can change styles as you want.</span><font face="Arial">
