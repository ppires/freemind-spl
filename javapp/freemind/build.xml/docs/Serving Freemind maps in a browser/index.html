<h1>Serving Freemind maps in a browser </h1>
<p>Ver 1.0 - 29 February 2004 </p>
<p>&nbsp;<b >Robert J. Alexander - Rome - Italy</b></p>
<p>(For any corrections or simple thanks 8-&gt; my email is <b>bob</b> and my provider is <b>ngi.it</b>)</p>
<p>Please read the <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> before using this document. </p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>After you create your wondrous mind maps using Freemind you will sometimes feel the need to share them with other people. Other than asking them to install Freemind, there is a simpler way: if you have access to a web server you will be able to have your users see your maps in their Java 1.4 enabled browsers without them having to install anything else. </p>
<p>The scenario we will be using is the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>We will quickly review the <a href="apache.html" title="Setting up Apache on XP">setup of an Apache 2.0.x web server on your Windows XP</a></li>
<li>We will install the <a href="freemind%20applet.html" title="Freemind's applet">Freemind applet</a> and it's launcher HTML on the web server </li>
<li>We will <a href="test.html" title="Testing">check out </a>if everything works as expected with our browsers </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>Please note that running a production web server on a Windows platform without being thoroughly skilled can create security issues. In my humble opinion this task is better suited to be carried out on a Unix (Linux, BSD, AIX etc.) machine with proper administration.</p>
<p>The reason for which I am writing this guide with Windows as the platform is that most basic issues are usually already understood by the Unix gurus out there 8-). </p>
