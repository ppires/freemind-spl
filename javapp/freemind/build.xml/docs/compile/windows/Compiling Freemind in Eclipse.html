<h3>Compiling Freemind in Eclipse </h3>
<p>Now if you switch to the “Resource Perspective” you will see a “freemind” entry:</p>
<p>Expand the “freemind” entry (forget about the other one … it is only an experiment of mine and you will probably not have it).</p>
<img border="0" width="575" height="411"src="images/image037.jpg"/>
<p>Select the “build.xml” file and right click on it and choose the “Run Ant” entry. You will see the following screen:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="576" height="529"src="images/image039.jpg"/></p>
<p>It should be exactly like you see above. Now select the Classpath entry from this window:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="576" height="529"src="images/image041.jpg"/></p>
<p>Click on the “Add External JARs…” button and select the tools.jar from the lib directory of the JDK you have downloaded. See next picture for the default filename:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="576" height="529"src="images/image043.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can see that we have added the C:/j2sdk1.4.2_02/lib/tools.jar file. You will have to perform this step only once of course.</p>
<p>Now click on the Run button and Freemind will be (hopefully) compiled.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="575" height="411"src="images/image045.jpg"/></p>
<p>You should see some messages about <em>Buildfile: C:\Programmi\eclipse\workspace\freemind\build.xml</em></p>
<p>from which you can understand that your local copy of the Freemind sources are hosted in the workspace\freemind subdirectory of your Eclipse program.</p>
<p>Your freshly compiled Freemind program will be produced into C:\Programmi\eclipse\workspace\bin\dist which contains all of Freemind needed files to run (of course you always need a JRE don't' you 8-&gt;).</p>
