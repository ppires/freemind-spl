<a name="faqA_0"><h2>Documentation</h2></a> 
<a name="faqA_1"><h3>Where can I find more documentation about FreeMind?</h3></a>
There is a <a href="http://freemind.freezope.org/FreemindWiki/WikiFreemindFAQ">Wiki</a> with some more answers to common questions and more. 

<a name="faqI_0"><h2>Installation</h2></a> 
<a name="faqI_1"><h3>How can I install Freemind?</h3></a>
<!-- As of version 0.7 there is an installer for Windows.  -->
FreeMind requires Java 1.4 or higher

If Java is not installed, please abort the installation and download the JRE - Java Runtime Environment from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">here.</a>

<a name="faqI_2"><h3>I installed Java JRE and FreeMind, execute freemind.exe (or the icon with the butterfly) and nothing happens. Why?</h3></a>
Your Java installation is buggy. Try to excecute using "Run command..." in the start menu the command
"javaw.exe". If this fails, you have to arrange your path settings, such that the java/bin directory is in your path.<p>
Or try to start the batch "freemind.bat", read the messages and react.

<a name="faqU_0"><h2>Usage</h2></a> 
<a name="faqU_1"><h3>How can I create a graphical link?</h3></a>
<!-- This is done by Drag&amp;Drop using the mouse, click on a node, hold the Shift and the Control keys and don't release them now,
move this node to the destination node, release the mouse button (and now you may also release the keys, but not earlier), 
and there is your link. -->
<ol>
<li>Go to the source node. </li>
<li>Mark it with the mouse. </li>
<li>Press the left mouse button. </li>
<li>Hold this button. </li>
<li>Press Ctrl+Shift buttons. </li>
<li>Continue to hold all these buttons.</li>
<li>Go to the destination node. </li>
<li>Release the mouse button, first. </li>
<li>Then release the keybord buttons. </li>
<li>You have your link.</li>
</ol>

<a name="faqU_2"><h3>How can I embed images into freemind?</h3></a>
This is contained in a context menu using right click (or whatever this is on a MAC) on a node. Or type the following:<p>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/html&gt; <p> where image.jpg is the reference to an image.

<a name="faqU_3"><h3>How can I present my map in the web?</h3></a>
Use the freemind browser applet. The following <a href="docs/Serving%20Freemind%20maps%20in%20a%20browser/index.html">document</a> (thanks to Bob) explains what to do to have a complete testing environment for your
applet. The most common problem to see a freemind browser applet is that you have to use Java >= 1.4 in your browser. Check this using the 
"About plugins" section of your browser (or a similar place).

<!-- next section -->
<a name="faqC_0"><h2>Customization</h2></a> 
<a name="faqC_1"><h3>Using another browser</h3></a> 

If you want to use another browser, edit the <a href="#faqC_2">user.properties</a> file and
change the following property according to your operation system:
<ul>
<li>default_browser_command_windows_nt</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_windows_9x</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_mac</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_other_os</li> 
</ul>
You have to write something like 
<ul><li>default_browser_command_windows_nt = C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe "{0}"</li></ul>


<a name="faqC_2"><h3>Editing the user properties</h3></a> 

The <b>user.properties</b> file resides in a subdirectory called "freemind" of your home directory. 
As an example, under Windows 2000, the file is normally in:
<ul>
<li>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\freemind</li> 
</ul>

<a name="faqC_3"><h3>Changing the language</h3></a> 
You have to edit your <a href="#faqC_2">user.properties</a> and to replace the line saying:
<ul>
<li><strong>#</strong>language = en</li> 
</ul>
With the line:
<ul>
<li>language = de</li> 
</ul>
(You have to remove the '#', too. That is important.) Now, restart FreeMind and you have changed the language to german. Other available languages are french (fr), danish (dk), spanish (es), italian (it), japanese (ja).<br>
If your language isn't supported yet, please translate the file <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/freemind/freemind/Resources_en.properties">Resource_en.properties</a> and send the result to the maintainers.

<a name="faqC_4"><h3>FreeMind on the Mac</h3></a> 
OK, FreeMind runs great as there is an own download version for it. But you have the problem, that there is no "insert" key on the Mac.
The solution is the following:<br>
You have to edit your <a href="#faqC_2">user.properties</a> and to replace the line saying:
<ul>
<li><strong>#</strong>keystroke_add_child = INSERT</li> 
</ul>
With the line:
<ul>
<li>keystroke_add_child = control shift ENTER</li> 
</ul>
(You have to remove the '#', too. That is important.) Now, you can add a new child to a node using the "control shift ENTER" key (or whatever you like and put instead of the above).


<a name="faqP_0"><h2>Common Problems</h2></a> 
<!-- Not necessary any more.
<a name="faqP_1"><h3>Cannot open the Documentation in the Help menu</h3></a> 
The path doc/maps/freemind.mm is not found. This is due to your own user.properties file which contains the wrong path
from the last version 0.6.7 of freemind. Yust delete the entry <b>docmapurl = ./doc/freemind.mm</b> from the user.properties.
-->

<a name="faqP_2"><h3>If there are more than one link in the same area, I cannot change the properties of the link</h3></a> 
The reason is that right clicking these links, the first link is taken that intersects a rectangle around the cursor. 
To get the other link(s), you have to find a place without other interfering links or you have to fold other links, such that they do not disturb. 

<a name="faqP_3"><h3>When using scandinavian characters (&aring;&auml;&ouml;&Aring;&Ouml;&Auml;) I see simple box instead of right sign.</h3></a> 
This discussion on linuxquestions might help some.
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/152934">http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/history/152934</a>.

<a name="faqD_0"><h2>Development</h2></a> 
<a name="faqD_4"><h3>Where can I find the latest beta version of FreeMind?</h3></a> 
Look at <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/testversions/">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/testversions/</a>.

<a name="faqD_1"><h3>How to compile Freemind on my own?</h3></a> 

This is a longer story as you need some prerequisites. Thanks to Bob Alexander, we have a 
<a href="docs/compile/windows/Quick%20guide%20to%20compiling%20Freemind%20on%20an%20XP%20system.html">website</a> explaining the issue.

<a name="faqD_2"><h3>How to get the sources from Sourceforge?</h3></a> 

See <a href="#faqD_1">How to compile Freemind on my own?</a>.

<a name="faqD_3"><h3>How to use CVS with Eclipse?</h3></a> 

Thanks to Bob Alexander, we have a <a href="docs/Using CVS via Eclipse/index.html">website</a> explaining the issue.
But remember that it is difficult to change directory and file names under CVS. Moreover, it not easy to remove files completely.
So, take care checking files in. The project manager thanks a lot.

<a name="faqD_4"><h3>What do I need to do to become a developer?</h3></a> 

Due to project reasons, we cannot make you a developer with CVS access of FreeMind directly. You have to follow the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Generate a Sourceforge account.</li>

<li>Then, start to discuss the change/feature/bug in our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=22101"> open discussion forum</a>. </li>

<li>If the topic is discussed and hopefully accepted, start to change the actual CVS code (see on this page, how to compile Freemind from CVS).</li>

<li>At an early stage of your implementation (and testing), put a version into the patch section of sourceforge and/or send it directly to the current project manager. As this is an open project it may be the case that you have to wait a little time for the first responses, but you should get support, comments and help from the project members soon. </li>

<li>After having successfully developed and integrated some items, you get the developer rights at the sourceforge page to continue our good work. But this should not change the steps described above.</li>

</ul>
