<!--
On 3. Septeber 2003, <a href="http://mujweb.cz/www/danielpolansky/">Daniel
Polansky</a> says: Basically, FreeMind is without project manager now. I
will merge no coding sent to me by people into the standard, and I will not
get CVS running. I may do some update on pages or maybe sent some updates of
my coding. If someone wants to take FreeMind over, he's welcome. Until a new
manager or main programmer is found, partial participation on the project is
not possible.

-->

<!--
<p>
I am not willing to do more coding himself, except perhaps for some
incorporations of coding done by other people. We are looking for
developers, as the question "what" has already been relatively well
answered. The priorization is not completely clear, but also not completely
random. If you would like to develop FreeMind, you may choose from what
needs to be developed or develop that which <i>you</i> consider most
important. I will review your changes and add them to Source Forge. If you
keep on providing reasonable changes which do not need much checking from my
side, I'll add you admin rights on Source Forge.
<p>

<a name="h3_1"><h3>For developers</h3></a>

Apart from the documentation pointed to from above, you can learn
a lot from FreeMind's development map.

<ul style="list-style: none">

  <li><a href="Freemind-development.html">Freemind development map</a>
    viewed in FreeMind applet; requires Java1.4.

  <li><a href="Freemind-development.mm">Freemind development map for
                download</a> 

  <li><a href="Freemind-development-exported.html">Freemind development map in
  folding HTML</a> (is reported to crash Mozilla on Linux. This is probably
  because of extensive use of layers.)

</ul>

To get <b>API documentation</b>, see generated <a
href="javadoc/index.html">JavaDoc</a> of FreeMind.

<a name="h3_2"><h3>New project manager wanted</h3></a>


<b>We are looking for new project manager</b>. 

I will play
that role in the near future, but I am going to be quite passive, as I have
already spend incredible amount of time with FreeMind and I also need to get
some other things done in my life.

If you want to be the new project manager or contribute and articulate ideas
to further development, <b>enter the discussion at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=22101">Open
Discussion</a></b>. We really need to articulate things before be move
further, although there are many quite obvious things to implement in
FreeMind.
<p>
If you want to become the new FreeMind's project manager, the following will
happen:

<ul>
<li>You'll have user at Source Forge 
<li>You'll be able to upload new files at Source Forge and 
to update FreeMind's Web page / home page at Source Forge
<li>You'll change the name of project responsible to your name at 
FreeMind's Web page / home page at Source Forge, including e-mail address 
<li>You'll handle all the communication with users 
<li>I'll forward all the relevant mails addressed to me to your 
e-mail address, for you to handle them 
<li>You'll get CVS at FreeMind's Source Forge project page working again,
or, if you don't want to manage development through CVS, you'll come up with
an alternative
<li>You'll dispatch developers who are adding new improvements to 
FreeMind, review the improvements, accept them or refuse them 
<li>You'll use RFEs (Requests for features) and Bug Reports at Source Forge
for managing the project, or devise an alternative
</ul>

More and ideally, but not necessarily, you'll make sure that the following areas are taken care of:
<ul>
<li>creating of a good logotype (based on original butterfly?)
<li>marketing: making sure FreeMind is referenced, well indexed and easy to
find
<li>marketing: better examples of uses, dealing with authors who are writing
articles about mind mapping etc.
</ul>

<a name="h3_3"><h3>Modular view / model design</h3></a> 

The architecture of FreeMind makes it possible that FreeMind becomes general
tool for editing tree-structured data, that is Mind maps, XML/HTML
Documents, Directory trees etc. in future.
<p>

All these kinds of data would be presented to the user as a Mind map. This
is due to Model / View / Controller modular design - you only need to write
so called <i>model</i> of the data structure, without caring for the visual
representation. Currently, Mind Map Mode and File Mode are implemented.

<a name="h3_4"><h3>Joerg's original vision</h3></a> 

What I had in mind when I began to write FreeMind, was creating a
collaborative mind where people can intuitively share there ideas, knowledge
and thoughts with each other. Of course FreeMind is only a first step into
this direction, but I did this first step. Now a Mode must be implemented
that makes collaboration over the Internet possible, maybe using the
Topic-Map standard. I think linear text is a very poor way of representing
knowledge, and by using trees and networks, visual representation, internet
collaboration and open source we should be able to create some kind of a
collaborative mind.
<p>

FreeMind now has evolved from a specific Mind Map Editor to a generic editor
for tree structured data. I want FreeMind to become for tree structured data
what emacs is for linear data (ie. text).
<p>

One may think of extending FreeMind to work with networks as opposed to
trees only, an example of this being Topic Maps (ISO).
<p>

<i>Daniel:</i>
<p>
Joerg's vision of FreeMind becoming Emacs for tree data is intriguing, but
rather far fetched at the time. You would need to provide scripting facility
and at least many basic operations, like upcase, downcase, replace and many
others. It is even not evident that this goal is of value; obviously there
are many quite basic and valuable features missing, which have nothing to do
with that idea.
