Notes:


Dear FreeMind users,  
 
with this release, we continue the series of release candidates for
the final version 0.9.0. It fixes some important bugs.

For translators may still update the translations to the current
 set of strings, which hasn't changed since RC3.
 
For testers: we need *everybody* to do tests. From the simplest to the
hardest (e.g. memory and performance tests using profilers).
If you have time - join us and tell your results 
(in the open discussion forum or in the bugs section).  
 
Best regards,  
 
Chris  
        

Changes:

===============================
Changes made in FreeMind 0.9.0 RC 6

* Fixed: Plain text Long node gets corrupted (loses newlines) on drag * http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2844139&group_id=7118&atid=107118
* Fixed: Question before delete issued from the menu added
* Fixed: Message on status bar is cleared before save.

* We now create two different versions for Mac: for OSX 10.5 Rosetta, there is a different one.
  These versions differ only in the way, the JavaApplicationStub is handled (the Rosetta version
  takes a copy from my laptop, the other version uses a symbolic link to 
  /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub)
