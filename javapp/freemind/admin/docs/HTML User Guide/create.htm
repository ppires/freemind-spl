<p><font face="Arial">You create mindmaps in &quot;mindmap&quot; mode, which is how FreeMind starts up.</font><p><font face="Arial">Create a new map by opening the 
File menu and clicking New.&nbsp; </font><p><font face="Arial">FreeMind will 
create a new screen, with an oval in the center labeled &quot;New mindmap&quot;. This is 
the &quot;root node&quot;. You will build your map by adding nodes to the root. </font><p>
<font face="Arial">For a look at the screen with a small map, see the
<a href="screen.html">&nbsp;FreeMind interface</a>.</font><p>
<font face="Arial">The new root node will be highlighted with gray, which means 
it's currently selected. Clicking on it&nbsp; will open the text for editing. 
Do this and enter a name, such as &quot;My Ideas&quot;, and hit Enter.</font><p>
<font face="Arial">When you right-click on a node, you'll see a context menu 
that offers several options, such as &quot;New Child Node&quot;. Notice that many of the 
options also have shortcut keys.&nbsp; For example, you can add a child node to 
your root node by selecting it and hitting the Insert key.</font><p>
<font face="Arial">The root node can only have <i>child nodes</i>.&nbsp; With other 
nodes, you can create <i>sibling nodes</i> (at the same level) or child nodes. Nodes 
are connected by lines known as edges.</font><p><font face="Arial">As you build 
your map, you can set colors, sizes, fonts and other attributes to emphasize 
nodes and edges. For example, you might want to highlight all &quot;action items&quot; in 
red. Nodes can be &quot;folded&quot; or &quot;unfolded&quot; by clicking on them. Unfolding a node 
displays the nodes below it. You can also insert, delete and rearrange nodes 
quickly. See <a href="edithome.htm">Editing your maps</a> for details.</font><p>
