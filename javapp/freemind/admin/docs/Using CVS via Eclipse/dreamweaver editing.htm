<h1>Editing local files with Dreamweaver</h1>
<p>This topic is really quite optional.</p>
<p> You could edit your files with just about anything, but as the files we are using in this document are a bunch of HTML files, I am using a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver MX 2004</a> from Macromedia (have no commercial interest 8-&gt;) to handle them.</p>
<p>I find this product very good and THE feature which lacks most for my usage is a native CVS support !</p>
<p>This section is very short. Here is a snapshot of how it looks which probably explains everything. Do not be confused by the fact that the picture shows this very same document being edited in Dreamweaver ... it is not your browser getting mixed up!</p>
